If you are running a version different than 1.0.0 and the FEMC is installed in a Front End, please contact avaccari@nrao.edu before updating to the new version.


You will need:
- access to the front panel of the FEMC
- a computer with a terminal software such as (hyperterminal, secureCRT or equivalent that support z-modem transfer) and a serial port
- a null modem cable


Notes:
The provided frontend.v2 file only differs from the previous version by the numbering of the bands, they now reflect the human numbering 1-10 instead of 0-9.
Also in this file, all the cartridges are available. You might want to edit the file before or after installing it (beware of the CR/LF when crossing OSs) to mark the unused cartridges as not available replacing the "Y" with an "N". The file is self-explanatory onece opened. This step is not necessary but it will speed up the booting process.
To edit the file after is transferred to the module and renamed, you can use the command:
"ned frontend.ini"
this will open an editor:
- you can control the cursor with CTRL+"a"(left), "s" (down), "w" (up), "d" (right)
- to save <esc>,"f","s"
- to exit <esc>,"f","x"


Procedure:
- download the 02-00-00.exe and download and uncompress frontend.zip files from EDM:
  http://edm.alma.cl/forums/alma/dispatch.cgi/iptfedocs/showFolder/104236/def/def/3752931
- turn off any activity on the CAN bus but leave the FEMC powered
- connect the serial cable to the computer and the FEMC
- start your terminal software with the following options:
  - Baud rate: 115200
  - Data Bits: 8
  - Stop Bits: 1
  - Parity: none
  - No flow control
- once the communication is established push <enter> a couple of time to verify that you can talk to the FEMC
- push "q" <enter>. This should bring you to the dos promt C:\ALMA>
- create a directory with the command "mkdir v1" <enter>
- copy the fe_mc.exe and frontend.ini files to v1:
  - "copy fe_mc.exe v1" <enter>
  - "copy frontend.ini v1" <enter>
- delete the fe_mc.exe and frontend.ini files from the ALMA directory:
  - "del fe_mc.exe" <enter>
  - "del frontend.ini" <enter>
- use whatever is required by your terminal software to transfer with z-modem the 02-00-00.exe and frontend.v2 files. If the FEMC doesn't automatically activate the z-modem reception, type the following in the DOS prompt:
  - "rz" <enter>
- copy the 02-00-00.exe and frontend.v2 files to fe_mc.exe and frontend.ini:
  - "copy 02-00-00.exe fe_mc.exe" <enter>
  - "copy frontend.v2 frontend.ini" <enter>
- delete the 02-00-00.exe and frontend.v2 files from the ALMA directory:
  - "del 02-00-00.exe" <enter>
  - "del frontend.v2" <enter>
- power cycle the unit and verify that the software is going through initialization
- push <enter> once the initialization is finished and you should see the following:
  
  Front End Monitor and Control Firmware (FEND-40.04.03.03-011-A-FRM)

  Revision: 2.0.0 (2009-02-25)

  Bug report: jira.alma.cl

  Console help
   ' -> retypes last command
   " -> repeats last command
   q<CR> -> quit
   r<CR> -> restart
   d<CR> -> disable console
   i<CR> -> display version information
   m RCA<CR> -> monitor the specified address
             RCA is the Relative CAN Address.
                 It can be in decimal or exadecimal (0x...) format
                 For a list of the RCAs check:
                 - ALMA-40.00.00.00-75.35.25.00-X-ICD
   c RCA q data <CR> -> control the specified address
                     RCA is the Relative CAN Address.
                         It can be in decimal or exadecimal (0x...) format
                         For a list of the RCAs check:
                         - ALMA-40.00.00.00-75.35.25.00-X-ICD
                     q is the qualifier for the payload:
                       b for a byte or a boolean
                       i for an unsigned integer
                       f for a float
                     data is the payload in the format specified by the qualifier

- Disconnect the serial cable and restart your CAN control software.
