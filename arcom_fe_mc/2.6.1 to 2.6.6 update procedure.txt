You will need:
- access to the front panel of the FEMC
- a computer with a terminal software such as (hyperterminal, secureCRT or equivalent that support z-modem transfer) and a serial port
- a null modem cable


Notes:


Procedure:
- download the 02-06-06.exe file from EDM:
  http://edm.alma.cl/forums/alma/dispatch.cgi/iptfedocs/showFolder/104236/def/def/3752931
- turn off any activity on the CAN bus but leave the FEMC powered
- connect the serial cable to the computer and the FEMC
- start your terminal software with the following options:
  - Baud rate: 115200
  - Data Bits: 8
  - Stop Bits: 1
  - Parity: none
  - No flow control
- once the communication is established push <enter> a couple of time to verify that you can talk to the FEMC.
- push "i" <enter>. This should give you the software revision information. 
- push "q" <enter>. This should bring you to the dos promt C:\ALMA>
- type "verify on" <enter> to enable the verification of the operations by the operating system
- create a directory with the command "mkdir v2-6-1" <enter>
- copy the fe_mc.exe to v2-6-1 for backup:
  - "copy fe_mc.exe v2-6-1" <enter>
- delete the fe_mc.exe from the ALMA directory:
  - "del fe_mc.exe" <enter>
- use whatever is required by your terminal software to transfer with z-modem the 02-06-06.exe file. If the FEMC doesn't automatically activate the z-modem reception, type the following in the DOS prompt:
  - "rz" <enter>
- copy the 02-06-06.exe to fe_mc.exe:
  - "copy 02-06-06.exe fe_mc.exe" <enter>
- type "verify off" <enter> to disable the verification of the operations by the operating system
- power cycle the unit and verify that the software is going through initialization
- push <enter> once the initialization is finished and you should see something similar to the following:
