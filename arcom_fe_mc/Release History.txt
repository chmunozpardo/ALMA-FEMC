2010-11-04  002.005.000     (fe_mc.exe or 02-05-00.exe or 2101104.exe)
    Official Release
    This version is tagged Ver_02_05_00(ALMA-40_00_00_00-75_35_25_00_B_ICD).
    - The limits for the control message to modify the IF switch channels
      attenuation are now hardcoded and implemented. (Jira ticket: FE-270)
    - The limits for the control message to modify the YTO coarse tuning are
      now hardcoded and implemented. (Jira ticket: FE-269)
    - A direct communication test between the main board and the multiplexer
      board has been added during boot up time. This test will assure that
      the communication is established before allowing further execution of
      the code. (Jira ticket: FE-45)
    - The error counting and returning has been fixed. (Jira ticket: FE-151)
    - The limits for the control message to set the LPR optical channel are
      now hardcoded and implemented. (Jira ticket: FE-258)
    - The limits for the control message to set the IF switch cartrdige are
      now hardcoded and implemented. (Jira ticket: FE-238)
    - The monitoring of the gate valve has been modified to allow monitoring
      also when the backing pump is turned off. In this case the evaluation
      of the state is based only on 2 of the 4 sensors but an evaluation of
      the current state is still possible. (Jira ticket: FE-232)
    - Modified scaling for LPR laser photodetector current and removed the
      hardware undefined error. This point will return meaningful data only
      for LPR SN.226 and above. It is not implemented in previous serial
      number. (Jira ticket: FE-233)

2010-08-11  002.004.000     (fe_mc.exe or 02-04-00.exe or 2100811.exe)
    Official Release
    This version is tagged Ver_02_04_00(ALMA-40_00_00_00-75_35_25_00_B_ICD).
    - Modified interface to cryostat to support both hardware revisions of the
      crysotat M&C board. The two hardware revisions require different scaling
      to be applied to the readback voltage before a conversion to the actual
      temperature can be performed. (Jira ticket: FE-220)
    - Adjusted the scaling for the PRT sensor for higher accuracy.
    - Increase to 100ms the time between the temperature channel switching and
      an the initiation of the ADC conversion in the cryostat. This should
      allow for more stable readings. This timeout doesn't affect any CAN
      interface timing since it's running in an async process.

2010-04-28  002.003.000     (fe_mc.exe or 02-03-00.exe or 2100428.exe)
    Official Release
    This version is tagged Ver_02_03_00(ALMA-40_00_00_00-75_35_25_00_B_ICD).
    - During initialization of the OWB, the detected ESNs will be reported
      both with the family code first and with the family code last.
      (Jira ticket: HANDOVER-879)
    - Modified interface to IF switch to support both hardware revisions of
      the IF switch M&C board. (Jira ticket: FE-158)
    - Resolved issue with IF switch temperatures monitoring returning
      errors. (Jira tickets: FE-154, AIV-1675)
    - Fixed issue that will leave timer running if error during wait for
      ADC to get ready in several subsystems.
    - Changes B9 SIS heater timeout to 10s. Also created independent
      timeouts one for each polarization.
    - Added the support for different multiplier scales via the WCA
      configuration files. (Jira ticket: FE-153)

2009-10-13  002.002.000     (fe_mc.exe or 02-02-00.exe or 2k91013.exe
    Official Release
    This version is tagged Ver_02_02_00(ALMA-40_00_00_00-75_35_25_00_B_ICD).
    - Modified scaling factor for LPR temperature sensors
    - Added timer to prevent band 9 heater from being turned on more than once
      every 10 second.
    - Added console switch to turn on and off async processes to allow easier
      console debugging.
    - Added 'EDFA driver status' monitor point.
    - Changed scaling factor for the SIS heater current monitor to adapt to new
      BIAS module hardware.
    - Removed the SIS Heater Enable monitor point. This because the change in
      the BIAS module that introduced the auto shutoff causes the software to
      loose synchronization with the hardware state.
    - Reading WCA photmixer current twice (~100us) to get stable reading
    - Lowered to 5ms the timeout from power on to initialization of the CC and
      WCA
    - Implemented the error CAN interface.
    - The GET_ESN_FOUND monitor point will now reset the device index to the
      first device found.
    - The analog monitor for the BIAS and WCA now have a 40us delay between the
      selection of the channel and the beginning of the conversion. This was
      needed to fix an issue with speed of the analog circuits.
    - An asynchronous framework is in place to allow asyncronous operations to
      be performed in the background.
    - The cryostat analog monitoring is now attached to the asynchronous frame.
      Monitored data is stored in memory where it can be gathered with the
      standard CAN access.

      cartridge is initialized.
    - The current operation mode of the front end can be monitored. The setting
      is not implemented yet and it will not untill the safety checks are in
      place.
