2018-04-06 2.8.7
    Bugfix: fetimSerialInterface::getFetimExtTemp() stores in 
      frontend.fetim.compressor.temp[currentAsyncFetimExtTempModule] instead of [currentCompressorModule].
    Bugfix: he2press::pressHandler() returns last async value instead of reading synchronously.
    Renamed compTemp.* to fetimExtTemp.*
    Renamed all refs to "FETIM compressor temperature" to "FETIM external temperature"
    Delete DATABASE_RANGE stuff from (FETIM) compressor.c, fetimExtTemp.c, he2Press.c
    
2017-01-08 2.8.5
    Official accepted release to the ALMA array.

2016-10-20 2.6.11
    Prototype band 1 & band 2 support

2014-08-22 2.6.6
    Release version for FETIM testing at OSF
    GET_PPCOMM_TIME now returns 8 bytes of 0xFF, as the ICD says it should.
    SET_IF_SWITCH_CHANNEL[Po][Sb]_TEMP_SERVO_ENABLE now returns error if a value
      than 0 or 1 is sent.

2012-04-13  002.006.001     (fe_mc.exe or 02-06-01.exe or 20120413.exe)
    Official Release
    This version is tagged Ver_02_06_01(ALMA-40_00_00_00-75_35_25_00_C_ICD).
    - Allowed number to power up cartridges now depend on FE operation mode:
      troubleshooting: all, all the other modes: 3.
    - Cartrdige temperature sensors: added check to verify that the measured
      voltage is within the temperature calibration curve (for the lowest
      voltage -> highest temperature).
    - Assigned PA channel mapping for bands 5 and 10.
